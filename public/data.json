There are sparkling dresses and stiff suits or wornout pants and brand new skirts but my favorite piece of clothing is a sweatshirt that my father brought back for me from a trip to New York. It is bright green with the word New York on the front in black and blue which are my favourite colors. It is my absolute favourite piece of clothing because it came from so far away. It is also very cozy and warm on the inside. I wear as many times as I possibly can because I love it so much.",
